## Pedagogical Framework

### Self-Determination Theory
Number Ninja supports three psychological needs:

**Autonomy**
- Player chooses difficulty
- Decides speed vs. accuracy balance
- Controls own strategy

**Competence**
- Combo counter shows growing skill
- Achievements mark milestones
- Score provides concrete feedback

**Relatedness**
- Leaderboard connects to peers
- Shared achievement language
- Social comparison (healthy competition)

### Behavioral Psychology
**Variable Ratio Reinforcement**
- Achievements trigger at unpredictable times
- Creates strong engagement (like video games)
- Encourages continued practice

**Immediate Reinforcement**
- Instant score feedback
- Visual rewards (particles, animations)
- Reduces delay between action and consequence

**Progressive Difficulty**
- Three levels scaffold learning
- Players advance when ready
- Prevents frustration and boredom

## Strategy Guide

### Maximizing Score
1. **Prioritize Accuracy**: Wrong answers cost more than slow answers
2. **Build Early Combos**: Higher multipliers compound over time
3. **Stay Calm**: Anxiety increases errors
4. **Know Weak Facts**: Practice difficult tables separately
5. **Read Carefully**: Rushing causes careless mistakes

### Earning Achievements
- **First Blood**: Focus on first question
- **Triple Threat**: Three correct in a row
- **Unstoppable**: 10-combo requires perfect run
- **Flawless Start**: All 10 correct from beginning (hardest!)

### Combo Maintenance
- Take an extra second to verify your answer
- Use mnemonic strategies for tough facts
- Breathe between questions
- Don't panic when seeing 11× or 12× tables
- If unsure, eliminate obviously wrong answers first
