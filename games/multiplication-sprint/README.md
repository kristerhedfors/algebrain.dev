## Pedagogical Approach

### Research-Based Strategies
1. **Distributed Practice**: Short, frequent sessions are more effective than cramming
2. **Retrieval Practice**: Active recall strengthens memory more than passive review
3. **Interleaved Practice**: Mixing operations (multiply, add, subtract) improves learning
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Visual confirmation helps correct misconceptions
5. **Mastery Learning**: 100% accuracy requirement encourages thoroughness

### Differentiation
- **Self-Paced**: Grid format allows students to work at their own speed
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Three difficulty levels accommodate diverse learners
- **Low Stakes**: Local-only leaderboards reduce anxiety
- **Immediate Retry**: Unlimited attempts encourage persistence
